## Introduction

Welcome to the **Human-Geomonitor** GitHub organization! We are a dedicated group of citizen researchers with a passion for aggregating and visualizing humanitarian and climate data. Our mission is to leverage our skills as engineers and software developers to make a positive impact on the world.

## Who We Are

Human-Geomonitor is composed of individuals with backgrounds in engineering, software development, and data science. Our work is done on our free time and driven by our commitment to understanding and addressing the pressing issues of our time.

## What We Do

- **Data Aggregation:** We gather data from various sources, including open datasets, satellite imagery, and news articles. Our focus is on humanitarian crises and climate change, areas where data can drive critical insights and actions.

- **Data Visualization:** We create visualizations that make complex data accessible and understandable. Our goal is to provide tools and insights that can help policymakers, researchers, and the general public make informed decisions.

- **Open Source Projects:** All our projects are open source, and we welcome contributions from anyone who shares our vision.

## Our Projects

Here are some of the projects we are currently working on:

- **PyDTM:** A Python API to allow researchers to easily query [IOM's DTM API](https://dtm.iom.int/data-and-analysis/dtm-api).
- **Humanitarian Crisis Prediction Pipeline:** A pipeline using LLMs to agregate climate, economic, political and displacement data to better monitor and predict humanitarian crises.
